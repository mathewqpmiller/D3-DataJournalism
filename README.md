# D3: Data Journalism Visualization



## D3 Scatterplot and Interactive Scatterplot

The premise of the project was to provide results to a newspaper editor about some health risks facing particular demographics. The editor is relying on me to sift through the information from a U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The dataset is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau and the data set includes rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state.

### D3 Scatterplot

I need to create a scatterplot between the two data variables of People Without Healthcare vs. Percent in Poverty.
I will use D3 techniques taught in class and create a scatterplot representing all states with icons. Further, I will code this graphic in the app.js file of my homework directory.  It is curcial that I pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. My scatterplot appears in the image at the bottom of this section.

### D3 Dynamic Scatterplot

For the dynamic and interactive scatterplot, I am going to include more demographics and more risk factors. I'll need to place additional labels in this scatter plot and give them click-events so that users can decide which data to display. Additionally, I will need to animate the transitions of the icons' locations as well as the range of your axes. For this activity I have chosen to create three for each axis.
